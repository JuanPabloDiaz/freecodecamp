# FreeCodeCamp Collection Projects üìö

Embark on my journey through **[freeCodeCamp‚Äôs legacy Front End Development Certification!](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/1diazdev/legacy-front-end)** These projects showcase my growth in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, Sass, React, Node.js, Git, and GitHub. From mastering responsive design with Bootstrap to building interactive functionalities with React, each project reflects my dedication for learning and experimentation.

While working on the requirements to obtain the certifications, I created multiple projects, each with its own GitHub repository and website. However, I wasn't satisfied with the result. After some time, I realized that merging them into a single repository would be a great idea. This project was thus conceived, aiming to improve user experience and consolidate a more robust portfolio.
