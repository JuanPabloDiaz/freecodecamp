Remember when I built Jp·Shop, showcasing my passion for front-end development? Well, my journey never stops! This time, I'm thrilled to present a collection of 10 interactive projects honed during my freeCodeCamp certification.

Dive into diverse experiences like Simon Game, API's consumption, markdown previewer, Pomodoro Clock, and more – each pushing my boundaries and mastering different technologies.

Built with #React.js, #Vite.js, and Tailwind CSS, these projects offer a glimpse into my dedication to performance, user-friendliness, and modern design.
